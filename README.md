# Internet Computer Networking Course

## 1. Basic concepts

### 1.1 Historical context

- Smoke signal
- Light signal
- Fire signal
- Postal service / Mails service
- Telegraph
- Telephone
- Radio and TV
- ARPANET => Internet

### 1.2 What are computer networks?

- Autonomous computers interconnected by a single technology
- Media and communications

### 1.3 Why computer network is important?

- All world are connected by computing network

### 1.4 What are Bits and Bytes?

- Bits and Bytes are information units on Binary system that allow communication between devices.
- 8 bits = 1 byte
- Bytes are a unit of measurement for storing information in a computer. A byte is a set of 8 bits, and each bit is a binary digit that can have a value of either 0 or 1.

The computer interprets bytes as a series of bits, and each byte is used to represent a number, letter, special character, or other information. For example, in the case of characters, each letter, number, or symbol is represented by a number that is assigned in a coding standard such as ASCII or Unicode.

When information is inputted into a computer, whether through the keyboard or another input device, the information is converted into a series of bytes that the computer can understand and manipulate. The computer's processor can read and write bytes in memory, and programs can use bytes to perform calculations and process information.

It's important to note that the order in which bytes are interpreted may vary depending on the computer's architecture and the coding standard used. For example, the way bytes are interpreted may be different on a computer with an Intel processor compared to one with an ARM processor.

### 1.4 Classification of computer networks

- Transmission technology

  - 1:1 (Unicast)
  - 1:Several (Multicast)
  - 1:All (Broadcast)
    - PAN: Personal Network
    - LAN: Local Area Network
    - MAN: Metropolitan Area Network
    - WAN: Wireless Area Network

- Scale or size you can have
  - .
  - .
  - .

## 2. Network's Software

### 2.1 Network protocols

- Structure based on layers
- Hierarchy of protocols

### 2.2 TCP/IP Model

TCP/IP model have 4 layers

- Application layer (Top layer)
  - FTP: File Transfer Protocol.
  - SSH: Secure Shell.
  - SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
  - DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
  - DNS: Domain Name System.
  - RIP: Routing Information Protocol.
  - SNMP: Simple Network Management Protocol.
  - HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
- Transport layer
  - TCP: Transmission Control Protocol.
  - DCCP: Datagram Congestion Control Protocol.
  - MTP: Micro Transport Protocol.
  - UDP: User Datagram Protocol.
  - ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol.
  - FCP: Fibre Channel protocol.
- Internet layer
  - IP: Internet Protocol.
  - ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol
  - IPSEC: Internet Protocol security.
  - IGMP: Internet Group Management Protocol.
- Network interface layer (Bottom layer)
  - ARP: Address Resolution Protocol.
  - Ethernet: traditional technology for connecting devices in a LAN network.
  - NDP: Neighbor Discovery Protocol.
  - L2TP: Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol.

#### 2.2.1 Identifier network: IP and structure

- 4 numbers separate by a dot (.)
- Each one of 4 number represent 4 bytes = 32 bits
- 1 bit = 0 or 1 it mean binary system.
- Each one of 4 number can be between: 0 - 255

#### 2.2.2 Sort of networks: assign of IP address

### 2.3 OSI Model

- Open System Interconnection
- Better structured than TCP/IP
- Layer 8...

#### 2.3.1 Physic layer

#### 2.3.2 Data links layer

#### 2.3.3 Network layer

#### 2.3.4 Transport layer

#### 2.3.5 Session layer

#### 2.3.6 Presentation later

#### 2.3.7 Application layer
