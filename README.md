### 1.3 Why computer network is important?

- All world are connected by computing network

### 1.4 What are Bits and Bytes?

- Bits and Bytes are information units on Binary system that allow communication between devices.
- 8 bits = 1 byte
- Bytes are a unit of measurement for storing information in a computer. A byte is a set of 8 bits, and each bit is a binary digit that can have a value of either 0 or 1.

The computer interprets bytes as a series of bits, and each byte is used to represent a number, letter, special character, or other information. For example, in the case of characters, each letter, number, or symbol is represented by a number that is assigned in a coding standard such as ASCII or Unicode.

When information is inputted into a computer, whether through the keyboard or another input device, the information is converted into a series of bytes that the computer can understand and manipulate. The computer's processor can read and write bytes in memory, and programs can use bytes to perform calculations and process information.

It's important to note that the order in which bytes are interpreted may vary depending on the computer's architecture and the coding standard used. For example, the way bytes are interpreted may be different on a computer with an Intel processor compared to one with an ARM processor.
